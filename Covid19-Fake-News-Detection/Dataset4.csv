damian ones twos today elliot today going talking hot topic going talking coronavirus couple weeks ago maybe couple months ago another show coronavirus assessing whether thought really dangerous whether bit kicking frenzy going media little overblown todays show going looking potential solution people think hopefully make use talk clinical utility using highdose vitamin c coronavirus quite lot interesting information come recently top wellestablished information know vitamin cs potential uses viruses coronavirus virus good reason think come virus immunocompromised little susceptible succumbing kind viral infection using vitamin c high doses various different methods consumption likely going helpfulfirst want talk one recent progressions come china long ago china announced would thinking using intravenous vitamin c coronavirus patients three studies done china believe looking effect vitamin c coronavirus come pretty good results one chinese medical establishments scientists advocating use anywhere 6000 mg 24000 mg vitamin c used intravenously think severe patients viral infection doug interesting thing doses talking 600012000 mg vitamin c iv thats even really high know things like cancer protocols get high 100g even higher sometimes low dose means could take 6000 mg orally fact getting good results doses says lot power vitamin c think erica definitely mainstream news least us poohpoohing alternative things dont think vitamin c going cure really concerning take something going keep immune system strong instead essentially dumping baby bathwater saying nothing going work people sort vitamin c medicine cabinet types things good keep immune system strong doug astounding nonetheless shocking way media downplaying seen people reporting havent even mentioned china actually using vitamin c strategy coronavirus basically blanked like tulsa gab bard dont even mention fact despite fact many doctors china actually reporting talking explicitly saying helps news media turn around ignore fact even go far condemn thats right word like said erica poohpooh essentially oh wait vaccine dont bother woo hippy crap meanwhile even people taking 1000 mg vitamin c 3 4 times day would least helpful doesnt necessarily mean dont get going cure instantly anything help mitigate effects prevent stupid media taking kind stance elliot saw article earlier today abc news think one alphabet news agencies article titled coronavirus cures debunked talking vitamin c completely poohpoohing idea even like ignoring actively telling people take spineless things well established one top alternative integrated doctors quoted saying early sufficiently large doses intravenous vitamin c critical vitamin c prototypical antioxidant also involved viruskilling prevention viral replication significance large dose intravenous vitamin c antiviral level acute respiratory distress syndrome kills people coronavirus ards acute respiratory distress syndrome common final pathway leading death talking vitamin c one best ways protect especially going apply people susceptible kinds infections think fair say 98 people get probably going major issues mortality rate 12 people preexisting severe health conditions immunocompromisation etc kinds people wise take right precautions listening media quick whip hysteria dont provide solutions doug seems like almost point literally nothing except wash hands laughed thats thing keep saying wash hands wash hands reading somewhere someone talking disproportionate crazy hysteria pumping thing actually offering something wash hands disproportionate level threat like threat solution wash hands anything people actually could like take vitamin c saying thats going work wash hands actually article green med info called tons vitamin c wuhan maybe pull one damian scroll bit tweet dsm wanted show show truck delivering 50 tons vitamin c wuhan date one guess theyve cut date cant see article march 3rd clearly delivering 50 tons hell lot vitamin c using pretty disingenuous western media completely ignore fact outbreaks italy anywhere else start get awful could benefit information doctors could benefit could actually

already contracted also talking nebulizing hydrogen peroxide destroys sorts viruses body help vitamin c magnesium mop rest virus thats pretty helpful people freaking dont think anything something keep taking preventative measure anything doug professional doctors intravenous vitamin c probably stated even dont access intravenous vitamin c people actually still worthwhile taking orally well take much start feel digestive symptoms real side effects except diarrhea take much would rather deal coronavirus bit upset tummy mention website article talking came actually perfect site go orthomolecularorg scroll says news releases number things specifically use vitamin c coronavirus talk used wuhan different chinese doctors reporting anybody interested information good resource erica something like liposomal know talked show making liposomal vitamin c survives digestive tract little better obviously intravenous get much liposomal encapsulated spheres survive digestive tract get body effectively doug basically increasing absorption nutrient take certain percentage get absorbed rest wont taking liposomal biospheric sometimes called increases amount getting across digestive tract bloodstream yeah effective elliot making cant really make effectively people claim make doesnt hold testing make proper liposomal need proper liposomal technology really want liposomal vitamin c better getting really high quality one paying money high quality vitamin c could probably get similar benefits taking small amount multiple times throughout day wouldnt take high dose one given time absorb much one given time taking 1g every hour going continual absorption going opening transporters absorb makes sense lots options cant get intravenous liposomal oral going route take terms vitamin c actually many ways look vitamin c well known immune booster primarily one level promoting immune cells function certain immune cells responsible engulfing pathogens identifying clearing infections

atp idea vitamin c working way cells synthesizing energy form atp using things called electron carriers something called nadh fadh2 transported mitochondria donating electron going another various set processes make usable energy virus infects cell disrupts mitochondria functioning longer actually become depleted nadh nadh unable effectively donate electron ascorbic acid take place nadh act electron donor synthesize energy almost like ascorbic acid act energy source cells context immune dysfunction usually function ascorbic acid usually used antioxidant damage occurs cells called oxidation cells lose electrons function vitamin c donate electron called reduction essentially antioxidant used making energy whereas doris low saying cases mitochondria screwed viral infection vitamin c longer becomes antioxidant actually donating electron us make energy wellestablished fact might one reasons high doses actually necessary actually providing sustained form energy cells cells infected virus unable make means doug thats interesting elliot might one ways vitamin c actually beneficial aside roles one ways coronavirus messing immune system activating something called cytokine storm thats innate immune system inflammatory process ramps completely someone susceptible cant necessarily turn virus kills per se immune system inability shut immune system vitamin c potentially allowing us effectively shut immune system need lots different ways vitamin c might helping definitely antioxidant multiple different mechanisms absolutely fascinating would recommend listeners read called mitochondria coronavirus vitamin c connection people really need know vitamin c really useful shouldnt downplay effects antioxidant doug also used prooxidant well heard prooxidant capabilities well something immune system uses eliminate viruses bacteria things like elliot exactly think one main mechanisms cancer dont know happening viruses im familiar effect would make sense case take ascorbic acid low doses generally antioxidant youre giving ultrahigh doses actually generates hydrogen peroxide prooxidant effect particularly cancer cells quite selective cancer cells dont know would work viruses think works infections similarly think lots stuff dont know erica going back saying cytokine storm stress also effect reaction everyone fear stress people feeling im sure folks feeling europe also us stress adding cytokine storm inflammation body creating worse environment body ruminating stressing instead trying calm system elliot really unfortunate seems like causing lot harm inherently destructive sheer amount frenzy hysteria going seems relatively disproportionate actual threat coronavirus compare statistics infectious outbreaks seems relatively minor pretty much nothingburger opinion media makes worse boogeyman moment think people really scared understandably wellinformed wellinformed boost immune system kind stuff unfortunate ultimately really important know

parasites type immune cells responsible ones talking natural killer cells lymphocytes different things go around body constant lookout viruses bacteria pathogens sensitive cortisol cortisol quickly regulate system time regulate system responsible attacking tissues autoimmune conditions massively rise people tend get sick frequently well allowing get overly stressed definitely worst possible thing could want protect infection like difficult watching media doug turn erica saying show us walk outside things seem normal turn computer end world coming via coronavirus unknowns elliot anything else anyone would like say doug one thing could say popular conception vitamin c high oranges orange juice marketing want get actual vitamin c supplement amounts find foods unfortunately negligible talking therapeutic doses eating oranges drinking orange really going cut wanted point want taking least gram time 1000 micrograms damian milligrams doug milligrams thank damian 1000 micrograms going cut either erica probably better costeffective buy ascorbic acid powder opposed chewable ones flintstones make laughter know mean flintstones vitamins powder better cocktail got lord knows kind filers point dont buy flintstones vitamin c elliot much cheaper get powder get 100g 6 reason people often notice suffering kind infection tolerance goes way usually someone take 4 5 grams makes get digestive symptoms infection go least 5 times tolerate 5 times usually could tolerated know couple people managed go 30 40 grams poorly previously could tolerate 3g definitely get used way sick dont need much every day suffering infection find tends help erica proactive prevent stress mechanism taking keep making little detox cocktail vitamin c water enjoyable taste lot worse things doug true elliot ok

21 years i’ve kind place wanted show equipment room want talk covid19 minutes first thing want say look like there’s ventilator shortage there’s okay matter fact we’re running fewer ventilators right would normally run that’s people staying home they’re elective surgeries want talk numbers criteria goes covid patient patient investigation what’s also called pub basically right way last couple months locked us patient came respiratory problem labeled covid doesn’t matter it’s got stage 4 lung cancer pancreatitis heart disease liver failure everything else – you’re still come breathing problems you’re labeled covid patient one lady could testing first would go … tests went cdc one person qualified test whole place several patients investigations never tested maybe died whatever would die covid stage 4 lung cancer things clear what’s come every single patient needs one pieces equipment … need stuff okay ruleout covid tests taken long 2 3 weeks get back we’re finally getting claim they’ve claiming month we’re finally getting inhouse testing that’s going change game think that’s that’s what’s going places also means isn’t you’re going see numbers either go go would suspect we’re going see spike spike real quick reason number deaths recognize every single patient covid investigation dies goes covid death they’re showing numbers like football game scare they’re showing

billion doses global population bill gates looks whats already done create vaccine coronavirus one questions get asked days world able go back way things december coronavirus pandemic answer always almost perfect drug treat covid19 almost every person planet vaccinated coronavirus former unlikely happen anytime soon we’d need miracle treatment least 95 percent effective stop outbreak drug candidates right nowhere near powerful could save lot lives aren’t enough get us back normal leaves us vaccine read leading covid19 vaccine scientist answers questions launches global initiative create equitable access covid19 drugs vaccines humankind never urgent task creating broad immunity coronavirus realistically we’re going return normal need develop safe effective vaccine need make billions doses need get every part world need happen quickly possible sounds daunting foundation biggest funder vaccines world effort dwarfs anything we’ve ever worked it’s going require global cooperative effort like world never seen know it’ll get done there’s simply alternative here’s need know race create covid19 vaccine world creating vaccine historically fast timeline dr anthony fauci said thinks it’ll take around eighteen months develop coronavirus vaccine agree though could little 9 months long two years although eighteen months might sound like long time would fastest scientists created new vaccine development usually takes around five years pick disease target create vaccine test animals begin testing safety efficacy humans safety efficacy two important goals every vaccine safety exactly sounds like vaccine safe give people minor side effects like mild fever injection site pain acceptable don’t want inoculate people something makes sick efficacy measures well vaccine protects getting sick although you’d ideally want vaccine 100 percent efficacy many don’t example year’s flu vaccine around 45 percent effective test safety efficacy every vaccine goes three phases trialsphase one safety trial small group healthy volunteers gets vaccine candidate try different dosages create strongest immune response lowest effective dose without serious side effects you’ve settled formula move onto phase two tells well vaccine works people intended get time hundreds people get vaccine cohort include people different ages health statuses phase three give thousands people usually longest phase occurs what’s called “natural disease conditions” introduce large group people likely already risk infection target pathogen wait see vaccine reduces many people get sick vaccine passes three trial phases start building factories manufacture gets submitted various government agencies approval process works well vaccines normal development timeline isn’t good enough right every day cut process make huge difference world terms saving lives reducing trillions dollars economic damage speed process vaccine developers compressing timeline graphic shows howin traditional process steps sequential address key questions unknowns help mitigate financial risk since creating new vaccine expensive many candidates fail companies wait invest next step know previous step successful covid19 financing development issue governments organizations including foundation amazing alliance called coalition epidemic preparedness innovations made clear support whatever takes find vaccine scientists able save time several development steps example private sector governments foundation going start identifying facilities manufacture different potential vaccines facilities end going unused that’s okay it’s small price pay getting ahead production fortunately compressing trial timeline isn’t way take process usually takes five years get done 18 months another way we’re going testing lots different approaches time dozens candidates pipeline april 9 115 different covid19 vaccine candidates development pipeline think eight ten look particularly promising foundation going keep eye others see missed positive characteristics though promising candidates take variety approaches protecting body covid19 understand exactly means it’s helpful remember human immune system works disease pathogen gets system immune system responds producing antibodies antibodies attach substances called antigens surface microbe sends signal body attack immune system keeps record every microbe ever defeated quickly recognize destroy invaders make ill vaccines circumvent whole process teaching body defeat pathogen without ever getting sick two common types—and ones you’re probably familiar with—are inactivated live vaccines inactivated vaccines contain pathogens killed live vaccines hand made living pathogens weakened “attenuated” they’re highly effective prone side effects inactivated counterparts inactivated live vaccines consider “traditional” approaches much covid19 vaccine candidates types good reason they’re wellestablished know test manufacture downside they’re timeconsuming make there’s ton material dose vaccine material biological means grow takes time unfortunately that’s i’m particularly excited two new approaches candidates taking rna dna vaccines one new approaches pans we’ll likely able get vaccines whole world much faster sake simplicity i’m going explain rna vaccines dna vaccines similar different type genetic material method administration foundation—both funding cpi—has supporting development rna vaccine platform nearly decade planning use make vaccines diseases affect poor like malaria it’s looking like one promising options covid first candidate start human trials rna vaccine created company called moderna here’s rna vaccine works rather injecting pathogen’s antigen body instead give body genetic code needed produce antigen antigens appear outside cells immune system attacks them—and learns defeat future intruders process essentially turn body vaccine manufacturing unit rna vaccines let body work don’t require much material makes much faster manufacture there’s catch though don’t know sure yet rna viable platform vaccines since covid would first rna vaccine gate prove platform works creates immunity it’s bit like building computer system first piece software time even rna vaccine continues show promise still must continue pursuing options don’t know yet covid19 vaccine look like go full steam ahead many approaches possible might perfect vaccine yet—and that’s okay smallpox vaccine vaccine that’s wiped entire disease face earth it’s also pretty brutal receive left scar arm anyone got one every three people side effects bad enough keep home school work small—but insignificant—number developed serious reactions smallpox vaccine far perfect got job done covid19 vaccine might similar designing perfect vaccine we’d want completely safe 100 percent effective single dose gives lifelong protection easy store transport hope covid19 vaccine qualities given timeline we’re may two priorities mentioned earlier safety efficacy since might time multiyear studies conduct robust phase 1 safety trials make sure good realworld evidence vaccine completely safe use bit wiggle room efficacy suspect vaccine least 70 percent effective enough stop outbreak 60 percent effective vaccine useable might still see localized outbreaks anything 60 percent unlikely create enough herd immunity stop virus big challenge making sure vaccine works well older people older less effective vaccines immune system—like rest body—ages slower recognize attack invaders that’s big issue covid19 vaccine since older people vulnerable need make sure they’re protected shingles vaccine—which also targeted older people—combats amping strength vaccine it’s possible something similar covid although might come side effects health authorities could also ask people certain age get additional dose beyond safety efficacy couple factors considerhow many doses vaccine get easier quicker deliver may need multidose vaccine get enough efficacy long last ideally vaccine give longlasting protection might end one stops getting sick couple months like seasonal flu vaccine protects six months happens shortterm vaccine might used work durable one store many common vaccines kept 4 degrees c that’s around temperature average refrigerator storage transportation easy rna vaccines need stored much colder temperature—as low 80 degrees c—which make reaching certain parts world difficult hope vaccine 18 months close “perfect” possible even isn’t continue working improve happens suspect covid19 vaccine become part routine newborn immunization schedule vaccine though still huge problems solve that’s need manufacture distribute least 7 billion doses vaccine order stop pandemic need make vaccine available almost every person planet we’ve never delivered something every corner world mentioned earlier vaccines particularly difficult make store there’s lot can’t figure manufacturing distributing vaccine know exactly we’re working example able use existing vaccine factories make covid19 vaccine build different kinds vaccine factories prepare vaccine type requires different kind factory need ready facilities make type start manufacturing final vaccine vaccines soon cost billions dollars governments need quickly find mechanism making funding available foundation currently working cpi governments figure financing part discussions center get vaccine reality everyone able get vaccine time it’ll take months—or even years—to create 7 billion doses possibly 14 billion it’s multidose vaccine start distributing soon first batch ready go people agree health workers get vaccine first gets next older people teachers workers essential jobs think lowincome countries first receive people much higher risk dying places covid19 spread much quicker poor countries measures like physical distancing harder enact people poor underlying health makes vulnerable complications weak health systems make harder receive care need getting vaccine lowincome countries could save millions lives good news already organization expertise gave vaccine alliance vaccines manufacturers sign deal country factories located country gets first crack vaccines it’s unclear that’s happen hope find way get equitable basis whole world national health authorities need develop distribution plan better understanding we’re working eventually though we’re going scale thing vaccine available everyone we’ll able get back normal—and hopefully make decisions prevent us situation ever might bit hard see right light end tunnel we’re right things get vaccine quickly possible meantime urge continue following guidelines set local authorities ability get outbreak depend everyone part keep safe,1

sick understanding deadly disease many people really matters crucially developing public health response preparing hospitals healthcare system around world easily spread bad news new coronavirus appears spread much easily sars instead similar coronaviruses cause coldlike symptoms adana said virus spread fairly easily — may already fairly widespread — presents huge public health challenge“to complicate things even don’t know individuals likely spread virus” said peter hotel dean national school tropical medicine baylor college medicine “is serious respiratory infections coughing mild

mode transmission appears via droplets bits virusladen fluid person spews cough sneeze researchers still working conditions virus airborne meaning long viral particles linger air environmental conditions it’s also possible virus spread via fecaloral route meaning virus transmitted feces contaminate water food good hygiene lacking public health measures social distancing — slew tactics meant keep people congregating goal keeping people 6 feet apart one another six feet distance helps keep droplets infected person’s nose mouth hitting another person tactics include canceling schools public events closing restaurants banning events 10 people quarantine — restricting movement isolating people might exposed infection aren’t yet sick usually quarantine restricts person’s movement home isolation — separating people confirmed probable infections healthy people get better without infecting anyone else one member household could isolation perhaps designated room others enter members household quarantine free move around home enter isolation area lockdown — “the term ‘lockdown’ isn’t technical term used public health officials lawyers” lindsay wiley health law professor washington

state city might define “shelter place” slightly differently like “lockdown” term refer variety guidelines local government could also enforce orders differently — asking citizens volunteer basis

lockdowns won’t stop virus returning future measures loosened problem many people may succumb disease meantime attempting control spread hospitals medical systems overwhelmed achieving herd immunity uk would require 47 million britons infected could mean around hundreds thousands would die immunity might also last long enough help flu new strains emerge year relying herd immunity also conflicts policy anthony costello pediatrician former director tweeted “is ethical adopt policy threatens immediate casualties basis uncertain future benefit” two likely ways pandemic end virus widespread 1 many people get we’ll develop natural herd immunity term used describe people getting disease becoming immune result 2 we’ll make widely produce affordable vaccine unlikely we’ll see big decline covid19 cases solely due weather getting warmer plenty places currently warm weather like singapore australia covid19 cases easy answers “we recognize we’re gonna start seeing fair number hospital

molecule iron fe 2 center surrounded something called “porphyrin ring” cluster unique structures made oxygen carbon hydrogen special affinity oxygen atoms ability oxygen “leap” onto molecule lungs depends entirely structure also implies ionic charges complex molecules one thing note without presence histamine special protein heme group would higher affinity toward carbon monoxide oxygen meaning entire heme group would occupied carbon monoxide blocking absorption oxygen thus histamine presence critical allowing heme group bind oxygen mess histamine end forcing hemoglobin carry co instead o2 effectively creating oxygen deprivation blood heme group way special affinity carbon dioxide allows molecule carry co2 body’s cells transport co2 back lungs remember hemoglobin molecule must carry co2 o2 different times must attract release molecules opposite times order rid body co2 nourish body o2 accomplished delicate balance proteins protein folding hemoglobin molecule miracle nanotechnology transmorphs two different structural states based whether it’s carrying oxygen what’s called “rstate” molecule like magnet oxygen four oxygen atoms bound becomes highly stable structure appears red

819,5g new radio technology naturally concerned environmental health asking safe new antennas going outside apartment windows us tend keep phones quite close us times theres lot science subject also

cover radio waves general important relevant principles apply radio waves including cell phones 5g technology finally well get makes 5g unique also youre concerned topic came across alarming article tv segment dangers 5g make sure wasnt actually russian propaganda designed hold back us technologically economically yes russians exactly terminology looking whether phones might pose kind health risk humans doesnt take long run scarysounding terms like radiation absorption safe power levels also quickly run summaries research seem leave lot wiggle room include alarming statements like possibly carcinogenic humans order approach topic rationally vital take step back understand terms mean context statements written scientists strive use language scientifically accurate terms mean often quite different example term radiation comes lot youre like mind might jump something like chernobyl hear term dictionary definition word radiation emitting energy form waves particles broad includes great many things nothing radioactive particles phones radiate radio waves way speaker radiates sound fireplace radiates warmth thats radiation means scientist youll also see term absorption reference human flesh absorbing radio waves might also sound scary body absorb many frequencies radio waves means atoms tissue incrediblytinybutmeasurable way interacting waves unless live deep cave faraday cage body absorb radio waves day every day asking effect waves body valid question ask short version like putting hand front flashlight hand absorbs radio waves way absorbs light risk health later scientists researchers tend err side caution studying health risks theyre careful acknowledge unknowns risks however small bit like ads medical drugs ad tv might tell taking drug could lead death one person died clinical trial even theres evidence drug related death doctor knows trials tell drug extremely safe similarly youll probably never see reputable study unequivocally declares cell phones safe much average person would like hear thats simply serious scientific research works best hope ample research showing health risk exists risk small exactly later long risk levels uncertainty however insignificant scary phrasing like possibly carcinogenic humans classification radio waves international agency research cancer week context sound scary right lets put context first category possible
